WidsA1: Assignment 1; performed on a house price dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
I performed data analysis tasks, i.e., data cleaning, handling missing values, detecting outliers, encoding, scaling, and performing PCA with and without scikit-learn.
Later, to check the efficiency, I predicted the score using RandomForestRegressor model ( because of the data's high dimensionality and complexity).

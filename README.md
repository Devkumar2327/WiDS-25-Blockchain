Week 1:
WidsA1: Assignment 1: performed on a house price dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
I performed data analysis tasks, i.e., data cleaning, handling missing values, detecting outliers, encoding, scaling, and performing PCA with and without scikit-learn.
Later, to check the efficiency, I predicted the score using RandomForestRegressor model ( because of the data's high dimensionality and complexity).
Week 2: 
Studies MLE, MAP, SVM, Bayesian classification and decision tree.
Week 3:
Assignment 2: Digital Notebook (Designed a smart contract for a personal storage system). learnt solidity basics, ledger basics, bitcoin architecture, data structures in solidity.
